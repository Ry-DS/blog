If you're a meticulous sociopath like me, the thought of a bot capable of tracking people you haven't talked to in awhile and organising catch ups must have crossed your mind.
I'm probably not ready to give the entirely of my social planning to a robot just yet, but the thought of telling a program to schedule messages for planned catch ups sounds amazing.
In this post I plan to cover a program I made which schedules catch ups for me, so that i still have stuff to do on the weekend.
